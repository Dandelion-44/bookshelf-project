# ðŸ“š Bookshelf Project
This is a beginner-friendly Python project where I built a simple interactive digital bookshelf. It allows users to:

- Add books to a list âœ…

- Remove books from the list âœ…

- View all books on the shelf in a clean format âœ…

- Search for books using keywords âœ…

This project was especially meaningful to me because it's based on my real-life book collection, and I created it as part of my learning journey to become a data analyst. It was built in JupyterLite, making it completely browser-based and easy to run without installations.

# ðŸ”§ Features

- add_book(title) â€” Adds a single book to your bookshelf

- remove_book(title) â€” Removes a book from the shelf

- display_books() â€” Shows all books in a clean format

- search_books(keyword) â€” Searches for any book by keyword

- Future update: I'm planning to allow adding multiple books at once!

# ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python 3 (JupyterLite kernel)

- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

# ðŸŒ± Why I Made This

This was one of the first projects where I really began to understand core Python concepts like:

- Lists

- Functions

- Loops (for)

- Conditionals (if/else)

- String manipulation

I wrote the code step-by-step to help it really click, and now I use the bookshelf to track my actual reading collection!

# ðŸ“‚ How to Use

You can open the .ipynb notebook in:

- JupyterLite (just drag and drop the file into the browser)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Google Colab

  # ðŸ§  What I Learned

This project helped reinforce several foundational Python concepts that I had been practicing, including:

- How to define and call functions to make code reusable and organized

- How to use lists to store and manage collections of data (in this case, book titles!)

- How to loop through a list using for loops to display or search items

- How to use if/else logic to control program behavior, like checking if a book exists before removing it

- Basic string operations like formatting output and matching search keywords

More importantly, I gained confidence in writing code on my own, troubleshooting errors, and building something I could actually use in real life. This project was a big step forward in my Python journey.
